To change remote site for a local repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/K2Prasanna/JavaScript.git

To sync local with new remote, discard/overwrite local changes.
git fetch --all //downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything
git reset --hard origin/master //git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The --hard option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master
